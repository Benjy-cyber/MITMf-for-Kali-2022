# MITMf for Kali 2022

MITMf installation script for Kali by Savary Tech. 

Tested on:
*Kali 2022.2
*Kali 2022.3

There are two scripts:<br>
-One is for the first time you install MITMf, and the other is for continual use of the program. Always run the second script from inside the MITMf folder that is already there.

You can open the .sh file and manually copy and paste everything in it to your console, or you can run it as a script in your terminal. The latter is much easier.

To run it as a script use the command ```sh MITMf_Installation_FirstTime_SavaryTech.sh``` for the first time script and  ```sh MITMf_Installation_ContinuedUse_SavaryTech.sh``` for the continued use script.

The continued use script can be used as a way to troubleshoot the error "Module pyinotify not found." Again, be sure to run it from inside the MITMf folder.
